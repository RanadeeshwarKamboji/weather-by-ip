Features
Current Weather Retrieval: Fetches current weather conditions for a specified location (e.g., city name, ZIP code).
Modular Design: Separates concerns with dedicated controller and service layers (WeatherController.java, WeatherService.java).
Easy to Extend: Designed for straightforward addition of new features like multi-day forecasts or weather by IP address.
Technologies Used
Spring Boot: The foundational framework for building the application.
Java 17+: The programming language used.
Maven: For dependency management and building the project.
(Placeholder: External Weather API): This application integrates with an external weather provider to fetch real-time weather data. (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI.com, AccuWeather)
(Optional: Add other libraries you use, e.g., Lombok, Spring Data JPA, validation libraries)
Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
Download JDK
Apache Maven 3.6.0 or higher
Download Maven
An IDE (Optional but Recommended): IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, or Eclipse.
API Keys Configuration
This application relies on an external weather API. You must obtain an API key from your chosen weather provider and configure it in src/main/resources/application.properties (or application.yml).
# src/main/resources/application.properties (example)

# Replace with the actual base URL and your API key for the external weather service
external.weather.api.base-url=https://api.exampleweather.com/data/2.5/
external.weather.api.key=YOUR_EXTERNAL_WEATHER_API_KEY


(Adjust property names and values based on the actual external weather API you are using.)
Building the Project
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-weather-app.git
cd your-weather-app


Build the project using Maven:
mvn clean install

This command compiles the code, runs tests, and packages the application into a JAR file in the target/ directory.
Running the Application
You can run the application directly from the command line using the generated JAR file:
java -jar target/your-weather-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar


(Replace your-weather-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar with your actual project's JAR filename and version.)
The application will start on port 8080 by default. You can change this in src/main/resources/application.properties by adding or modifying the server.port property:
server.port=8080
API Endpoints
The base URL for the API will be http://localhost:8080.
GET /api/weather/current
Retrieves current weather conditions for a specified location.
URL: /api/weather/current
Method: GET
Query Parameters:
location (string, required): The city name (e.g., London, New York), or a combination like latitude,longitude if your WeatherService supports it.
Example Request:
GET http://localhost:8080/api/weather/current?location=London

(Adjust the endpoint path and parameter name if your WeatherController uses different mappings, e.g., @GetMapping("/weather") with @RequestParam("city"))
Example Success Response (HTTP 200 OK):
{
    "cityName": "London",
    "country": "UK",
    "temperatureCelsius": 15.0,
    "temperatureFahrenheit": 59.0,
    "weatherCondition": "Partly Cloudy",
    "humidity": 70,
    "windSpeedKmh": 10.5,
    "lastUpdated": "2025-07-02T10:00:00Z"
}

(IMPORTANT: You should replace this example JSON with the actual structure returned by your WeatherController's successful response.)
Example Error Response (HTTP 404 Not Found - Location Not Found):
{
    "timestamp": "2025-07-02T10:30:00.123Z",
    "status": 404,
    "error": "Not Found",
    "message": "Weather data for 'InvalidCity' could not be found. Please check the location name."
}

(IMPORTANT: You should replace this example JSON with the actual structure returned by your WeatherController's error response for a not-found location.)
